<h1>Nashville Hot Chicken</h1>

<img src="img/nashvillechicken.jpg" alt="a plate of crispy nashville Hot chicken">


As you'd expect, Nashville hot chicken is fried chicken with a major kick. 
The chicken gets a hefty dose of spice thanks to hot sauce and cayenne in the coating as well as a 
spicy sauce drizzled over the top. This version of fried chicken is served up with white bread and 
pickles to help balance out the heat.
